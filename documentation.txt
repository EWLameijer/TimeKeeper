Reading the text for the categories

The configuration file obeys the following rules:

1) Lines starting with # indicate a comment, it will be skipped by the configuration parser

2) The first non-#-starting line should be the label to use for unrecorded time, or 'gaps'. Like Gap or NoAdmin

3) Each line starting with a regular character (so no # or whitespace) will add another label/box to the window.

4) A line starting with a whitespace (like space or tab) will be interpreted as indicating a (case-insensitive) synonym for a time category

5) The first fully blank line stops the script.

Example:
